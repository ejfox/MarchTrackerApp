March Tracker App
===============

### This "march tracker" is an experiment in an idea of laying out events of political marches on a google map. 

[I have made experiments in this direction before](https://www.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=200010661405270055365.0004b689a116e2bd3c665). But this is my first foray into a custom interface for displaying events on a map. I am using Google Maps not only to display events, but to make sensible guesses about where the march has been based on different updates of it's location. The idea is to have a map that is not only updatable in real-time with pictures / tweets / info for tactical reasons, but to serve as a historical document showing events of a march without losing chronological order or geographic perspective. Just as livestreamers provide an up-close-and-personal live view of the action, I would like this map to serve as a live overview of the action.
